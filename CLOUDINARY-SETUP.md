   - Scroll down to "Upload presets" section
   - Click "Add upload preset"

3. **Configure Preset:**
   - **Preset name:** `zesho_uploads`
   - **Signing Mode:** Select "Unsigned" (Important!)
   - **Folder:** `zesho-materials` (optional, for organization)
   - **Resource type:** "Auto" 
   - **Access mode:** "Public"

4. **Save the preset**
