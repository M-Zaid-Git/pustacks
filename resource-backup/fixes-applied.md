# Resource Sharing Website - Fixes Applied

## Summary of Fixes

1. **API Import Path Resolution**

   - Created `src/api.js` to re-export the API module from its actual location at `src/api/index.js`
   - This fixed import errors in reducers and components that were looking for the API at '../api'

2. **LandingPage Loading Simplification**

   - Simplified the complex loading animation system in LandingPage/index.jsx
   - Reduced potential for loading state getting stuck
   - Removed overly complex resource loading checks that might fail
   - Added simpler, reliable loading progress with fixed timeouts

3. **Redux Store Integration**

   - Verified the correct configuration of reducers.mjs and store.mjs
   - Confirmed all reducers are correctly imported and combined

4. **Environment Variables**

   - Created a reference .env.example file with the necessary environment variables
   - Ensured API_URL is correctly set for the backend connection

5. **App Component Updates**
   - Updated App.jsx to use the original LandingPage component
   - Added debug logs to help diagnose any future issues

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**

   - Ensure the backend server is running at the URL specified in VITE_API_URL
   - Test API endpoints with Postman or similar tools

2. **Authentication Testing**

   - Test user registration and login functionality
   - Verify JWT token storage and retrieval

3. **Resource Upload/Download**

   - Test material upload functionality with Cloudinary integration
   - Verify download tracking is working correctly

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider further optimizing the landing page loading
   - Review and optimize any complex Redux operations

## Monitoring

- Added console logs in key components to help track the app's state
- Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests and Redux state changes
