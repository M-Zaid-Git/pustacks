# Troubleshooting Steps for ZESHO Website

## Current Status

- Website shows a white page with no content
- We've created a simplified version to test basic rendering

## Step-by-Step Recovery Plan

1. **Verify Basic Rendering**

   - Test if simplified App.test.jsx renders at http://localhost:5178/
   - If it renders correctly, the issue is in the app components or Firebase integration

2. **Restore Original Components Gradually**

   - Start with simple components like NavBar and Footer
   - Add more complex components one by one
   - Test after each addition

3. **Fix Firebase Integration**

   - Make Firebase optional for initial rendering
   - Add Firebase back with proper error handling
   - Test Firebase functionality separately

4. **Check Browser Console**

   - Observe any JavaScript errors
   - Fix errors one by one

5. **Clean Up Empty Files**
   - Remove or properly implement empty MongoDB-related files
   - Run cleanup.ps1 script to remove empty files

## Current Fixes Applied

1. Updated `.env` file to remove MongoDB references and add Firebase config
2. Modified Firebase initialization in main.jsx to handle errors gracefully
3. Created a simplified test version of App.jsx to verify basic rendering
4. Created a debug page to investigate Firebase and React issues

## Next Steps

1. If test page renders, gradually restore original App.jsx components
2. If test page doesn't render, investigate HTML/CSS issues
3. Once basic functionality is restored, optimize mobile menu and navigation

## For Reference

- Original app uses Firebase for authentication and data storage
- MongoDB references exist but are not properly implemented
- The app should work without requiring MongoDB
